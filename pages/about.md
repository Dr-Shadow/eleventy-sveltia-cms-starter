This is a template for building a simple blog website with the [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev), using GitHub as a data store, and with automated CI/CD deployment to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

It includes [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms) for content editing with Markdown, and [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling) for processing your site's form data.

It's loosely based on the [Eleventy Netlify Boilerplate](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-netlify-boilerplate) that uses Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS).

[Log in to Sveltia CMS with GitHub](/admin/)

For more info on installation and usage, view the [project repo]({{ pkg.repository.url }}) on GitHub.
